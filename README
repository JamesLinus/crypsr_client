This is the client-side code for cryp.sr, a minimal experimental host-proof
application. There's a blog post describing the design of cryp.sr here:

You can access the application itself here:

You should also know about AppHash - an associated Firefox addon that allows
you to automatically check the hash for a known set of pages. You can find it
